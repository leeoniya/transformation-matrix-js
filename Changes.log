Change log for 2D Transformation Matrix
---------------------------------------

1.3

ADD: New method applyToContext().

1.2

ADD: Two new helper methods flipX() and flipY()
ADD: Two new helper methods skewX() and skewY()
ADD: Two new helper methods scaleX() and scaleY()
ADD: Two new helper methods translateX() and translateY()
ADD: Helper method rotateDeg() to rotate by degrees
ADD: New method isEqual() to compare current matrix with another matrix
CHG: getInverse() and interpolate() no longer apply parent's context to returned matrix
CHG: Epsilon tolerance for floating point equal checks
REM: Previous (partly experimental) added methods for add/subtract removed due to non-linear nature.

1.1

ADD: New method reset()
ADD: New method add() (obsoleted)
ADD: New method addMatrix() (obsoleted)
ADD: New method subtract() (obsoleted)
ADD: New method subtractMatrix() (obsoleted)
CHG: NOTE: Method applyToPoint() takes pair of x/y instead of point object
CHG: Method applyToArray() can now take two forms of arrays (point objects and point pair values)
FIX: If context is provided it will now be initialized to identity matrix to enable 100% sync
FIX: Some documentation errors

1.0
